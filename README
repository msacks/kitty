This is a very basic command line JMX Client Written in Jython.
It takes two arguments, host and port for making a remote JMX connection and pulling memory statistics from a JVM.
I plan on extending the client to be robust, and perhaps build a Web interface on the engine for trending.

Any questions should be directed to matthew@matthewsacks.com.

System Requirements:
Requires Jython. Tested on 2.5.1.

Enhancements:
TODO: Remove optparse and replace cmd with cmd2 for option parsing
TODO: Bundle in a jar
TODO: Add useful help information
